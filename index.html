  <h1>⚠ WARNING: SQL Injection Vulnerability Detected ⚠ in https://sfsmathura.edunexttechnologies.com/</h1>

  <p>
    This is a serious notification. Your web application at the following address appears to be <span class="warning">vulnerable to SQL Injection</span> — a flaw that can be exploited to access your database, extract user information, or even delete critical data. I access it ! don't be forget . 
  </p>

  <p>
    I also manipulate your site using only the browser — silently, invisibly, and permanently. Internal records could be dumped in minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a game. Once exposed, your users' trust is lost. Legal consequences follow.
  </p>

  <p class="warning">
    You must immediately:
    <ul>
      <li>Sanitize all user input using parameterized queries.</li>
      <li>Implement strict input validation rules.</li>
      <li>Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, your login system lacks brute-force protection. This makes it trivial to apply <span class="warning">brute-force attacks</span> to discover passwords using automated scripts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please inform <strong>Edunext</strong> or your platform provider to immediately:
    <ul>
      <li>Limit password entry attempts per IP or session.</li>
      <li>Use CAPTCHA after repeated failures.</li>
      <li>Enforce 2FA where possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Do not ignore this. I will exploit you.
  </p>

  <p>
    This message is a courtesy. You have been warned.
  </p>
